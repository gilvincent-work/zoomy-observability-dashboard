// a-z0-9), so shipping_fee and pinned stay readable while api_key and refresh_token do not. Glued names (apikey) escape it on
// purpose: the value scanner (scrub.ts) and the one-time column review cover them. JSON keys use isSecretJsonKey (below), which also
// splits camelCase and knows the glued forms.
